# MouseRecordings
Powerful tool that allows users to simulate human-like mouse movements. 

## Saving Mouse Movement
With its ability to record and save mouse movements into path folders categorized into very long, medium, short and very short paths, this program can help users generate a path simulation from the current mouse position to the new button position.

## Random button positioning
The program's interface displays a button at a random position, and users must move the mouse to that button to create a path. When recording mouse movements, users can also set the offset of the new button coordinates using a normal/Gaussian distribution. This feature adds an element of randomness to the generated paths, making them more realistic and human. By adjusting the deviation settings, users can control the level of randomness in their simulated paths, allowing them to simulate more realistic and varied movements.

## Simulating Mouse Movement
Using the "Simulate" feature, users can generate a simulation of their desired path from the current mouse position to the new button position. The simulation is identical to the mouse path, but **transformed**, **rotated** and **scaled** to simulate the **same path with different start and end coordinates**.
Once the simulation is started, Mouse Recordings randomly loads paths from the folder where the paths are saved. When one path simulation ends, there is a pause of "n" seconds, after which the next randomly selected path begins. 

Furthermore, the program's ability to randomly select paths ensures that users can simulate a wide range of mouse movements, providing a comprehensive understanding of mouse behavior in different contexts. This feature is particularly useful for designers and developers who need to create user interfaces or software that can accommodate various types of mouse movements and behaviors.

## Setting Movement Speed
In addition to simulating paths at the original execution speed, Mouse Recordings also allows users to simulate paths at a slower or faster speed. This feature is particularly useful for analyzing and optimizing mouse movements in various scenarios where time is a critical factor.
